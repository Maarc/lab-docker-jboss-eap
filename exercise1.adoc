# Exercise 1

This is exercise is an introduction to Docker CLI and RHEL Container Development Kit.

## What you will learn
Particpants will learn how to use Red Hat Container Development Kit (CDK) and to start developing Red Hat Enterprise Linux based containers.

Participants will also learn how to use the Docker CLI to manage containers in a development environment.

### Starting Red Hat CDK environment
Red Hat CDK comes with a virtual machine that are optimized for running containers, called Red Hat Atomic. It uses Vagrant to manage the virtual machine and included boxes for VirtualBox and KVM (libvirt). The participants that uses a lab machine can run the labs without a virtual machine, since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 includes support for containers. However probably not all of the participants are using Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a Desktop at their workplace, so to give particpants as true real life experience as possible, they will use the same setup on the lab machines.

See <<boyd-setup.adoc#,Bring Your Own Device Setup Guide>> for information on how to install the software on your Mac OS X(R), Windows(R) or Linux(R) desktop.


. Create lab directory in your home directory and go into the directory

----
$ mkdir ~/lab && cd ~/lab
----
+
. Download the Vagrant file for the labs to the `lab` directory
+
[source,shell,numbered]
----
 $ wget -O Vagrantfile http://classroom.example.com/lab-setup/Vagrantfile
----
+
. Start the Vagrant container
+

----
$ vagrant up

### Get familar with Docker CLI
In this section you will learn the basic commands of the docker CLI so that you can manage and build containers

Step 1 - Start an interactive container::
The command for starting a container is `docker run` and it has a couple of important options. below are the most important options:
+
-i or --interactive=true::: Will start the container with an interactive terminal so that we can open even if we disconnect
-t::: Tells the run cammnd to allocate a pseudo TTY session
-d or --detach=true::: Detached mode: run the container in the background and print the new container ID. This option can not be combined with `-i` or `-t`.
-P or --publish-all=true::: Publish all exposed ports to random ports on the host interfaces
-p or --publish=[]::: Publish a container's port to the host
+
::
For more information on available options for the `run` command type `docker run --help` in a terminal.
+
Start a clean RHEL 7.1 container like this:
+
[source,shell,numbered]
----
$ docker run -it rhel7.1 bash
Unable to find image 'rhel7.1:latest' locally

Status: Downloaded newer image for classroom.example.com:5000/rhel7.1:latest
[root@d67ea0f4a238 /]#
----
+
NOTE: The output from the docker run command may differ and your hostname will differ from the example above
+
Congratulations! you have succesfully started a container using Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This container has it's own file system, own process tree, own IP address and it's own hostname. Let's investigate a bit closer:
+
[source,shell,numbered]
----
[root@d67ea0f4a238 /]# uname -a
Linux d67ea0f4a238 3.10.0-229.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Thu Jan 29 18:37:38 EST 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
[root@d67ea0f4a238 /]# cat /etc/redhat-release
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.1 (Maipo)
[root@d67ea0f4a238 /]# ps aux
bash: /usr/bin/ps: No such file or directory
----
+
The RHEL container, provided by Red Hat, is on purpose kept very minimal, the idea is that each service based on a container will define and install the it's own dependencies. Tools like ps (used to list running processes) is not installed in the RHEL container, but can easily be installed using `yum` like this:
+
[source,shell,numbered]
----
[root@d67ea0f4a238 /]# yum -y install procps

[root@d67ea0f4a238 /]# ps aux
USER        PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root          1  0.0  0.1  11744  1896 ?        Ss   16:04   0:00 bash

[root@d67ea0f4a238 /]#
----

Optional Step::
Findout and install package for ping, hostname, top
+
Go a head and stop the container by either pressing CTRL-D or by typing exit in the container prompt.
+
 [root@d67ea0f4a238 /]# exit
+
Using the above commands we started a bash shell in a container using Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1. From the prompt we can see that it is using a different hostname. From uname -a and /etc/redhat-release we can see that this is not an Red Hat Atomic, but actually a full blown RHEL7.1 container.
+
When we list the process of the container we can see that it has almost no processes running.
+
IMPORTANT: Installing packaged and changing configurations using the interactive console is strongly discouraged, since maintaining containers that requires manual setup is much harder thank maintaining containers that are automated.
+
TIP: The container that we stopped are not deleted. Using `docker ps -a` you can see the container and using `docker start -a <container-id>` you can start an reconnect to the container.

Step 2 - Start a daemon container::
Often it's more usefull to start a container as a daemon process. For example when a container is built to provide a service, like an application server or a database.
+
Run the following to start JBoss EAP 6.4 as a daemon process:
+
[source,shell,numbered]
----
$ docker run -dP jboss-eap-6/eap:6.4
3e336d31ce25cab777cf8ffd9c8779fbe0751455fa1e9c80cb30be69810ab8ae
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                 COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                     NAMES
3e336d31ce25  jboss-eap-6/eap:6.4   "/opt/eap/bin/standa   16 seconds ago      Up 14 seconds       0.0.0.0:49154->8080/tcp   pensive_euclid
----
+
The container running JBoss EAP is started add default public port 8080 is mapped to 49154 (mapped port may differ). Verify that the server responds by opening a browser to http://localhost:49154
+
NOTE: Using -P option all the exposes port (for JBoss EAP 8080) are automatically mapped to an available port on the server.
+
The browser should now show the JBoss EAP Welcome Page.
+

Step 3 - List, stop and delete containers::
When starting containers in deamon mode they are running in the backgrund untill the main process stops or until someone manually stops its. Let's stop the JBoss EAP container that we started in Step2.
+
[source,shell,numbered]
----
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                 COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                     NAMES

$ docker stop 3e336d31ce25

----
+
Let's start a a couple of containers

----
+
Wait 30 sec and then run `docker ps` again. This time no containers should be displayed. Now run `docker ps -a` and you should see the containers, but this time with STATUS Exited.
+
TIP: To remove the all the containers and free up the storage it's using excute the following command `docker rm $(docker ps -aq)`.

Step 4 - Override the command::
A container typically has a default command, for example the `jboss-eap-6/eap:6.4` container has a default command that looks like this `/opt/eap/bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0`. To override that command to for example to enable access to the administration console one have to add the option `-bmanagement 0.0.0.0`. This could look like this.
+
[source,shell,numbered]
----
$ docker run -d -p 9990:9990 jboss-eap-6/eap:6.4 /opt/eap/bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0 -bmanagement 0.0.0.0
----
+
Now open a browser to http://localhost:9990, which should give you the followig error page because we haven't added a admin user yet.
+
image::images/jboss-eap-error.png["JBoss EAP Error Page"]

Step 5 - Executing commands in a runing container::
We can execute commands directly to a running container using the `docker exec` command. To for example add a user one can run the following command.
+
[source,shell,numbered]
----
$ docker exec <container-id_or_name> /opt/eap/bin/add-user.sh -g admin -u admin -p admin-123 -s
----
+
Go back to the browser and click on the "Try Again" link. User username: admin and password: admin-123 to authenticate to the admin console and you should now see the admin console.
+
TIP: Use the following command to get shell access to a running contianer `docker exec -it <container-id> bash`. This will open bash shell in the running container so that you can check log files, investigate file permissions etc.

Step 6 - Customize a container::
All the commands in the previous steps are useful to know and great for development etc, but in a production environment you will most likely have a orchestration layer to manage start, stop, etc of containers. The build model of Docker allows us to extend existing containers and build our own customized versions. The benefits of build customized containers are:
+
* Standardization of:
** Tools
** 3rd party libraries
** Monitoring
* Versioning of containers
* Patching of containers
+
::
+
Customization is done in a specification file called Dockerfile. It contains a set of instructions on how to build an images. Below is an example of such a docker file, study it and make sure you understand the meaning of each line:
+
[source,shell]
----
FROM jboss-eap-6/eap:6.4  #<1>

RUN $JBOSS_HOME/bin/add-user.sh -g admin -u admin -p admin-123 -s #<2>

ENV JAVA_OPTS -client -XX:+TieredCompilation -XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1 -Xverify:none -Xms64m -Xmx256m -Dorg.apache.tomcat.util.LOW_MEMORY=true -XX:+UseCompressedOops -XX:+AggressiveOpts -XX:+DisableExplicitGC -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true  #<3>

ENV PRESERVE_JAVA_OPTS true #<4>

CMD $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0 -bmanagement 0.0.0.0 #<5>

EXPOSE 8080 9990 9999 #<6>
----
+
<1> Extending the JBoss EAP image that Red Hat provides
<2> Adding and admin user to the container
<3> Setting the JAVA_OPTS much lower than the original image for development purposes
<4> Needed to override the memory options in JBoss EAP
<5> The default start command
<6> Expose Web, Admin Web and Remote Admin API.
+
Such a specification file are provided to you as part of the lab content and standing in the `lab` directory you can build the image by executing the following command (replace your-alias with a unique identifier):
+
[source,shell]
----
$ docker build -t <your-alias>/jboss-eap:1.0 -f custom-jboss-eap/Dockerfile .
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                                   TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
tqvarnst/jboss-eap                           1.0                 db4848085173        44 seconds ago      530.6 MB
classroom.example.com:5000/jboss-eap-6/eap   6.4                 7a89f0810450        12 days ago         530.6 MB
classroom.example.com:5000/rhel7.1           latest              10acc31def5d        3 months ago        154.1 MB
----
+
Now we have build our customized version of JBoss EAP container so then we can much easier start container that have the configuration that we want.
+
[source,shell]
----
$ docker run -dP <your-alias>/jboss-eap:1.0
$ docker run -dP <your-alias>/jboss-eap:1.0
----
+
Use `docker ps` to indentify which ports are mapped and make sure that both the web (8080 in the container) and the admin web (9990 in the container) port are responding on localhost.

### Clean up and prepare for next exercise
Before we move on to the next exercise the participant should stop any running containers and remove any stopped containers. This can be done with two simple commands:

[source,shell]
----
$ docker stop $(docker ps -q)
$ docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
----

## Summary
After this exercise the participant should feel comfortalbe with starting, stoping and manage containers. The participant should be able to access a running container to check it's state, also should have basic understanding of networking (mapping ports etc). Further more the participant should gained an elementary knowledge on how to create custom images.
