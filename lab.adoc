This is the Lab participant guide, and will walk the particpant through the basics of Docker, and Kubernetes. It covers:

* Docker basics
* The Docker CLI
* Starting interactive and daemon containers
* Binding ports
* Creating your first `Dockerfile`
* Deploying Java EE applications to JBoss EAP running in a container
* Testing your application in the container using Arquillian
* Passing environment variables to the container
* Linking containers
* Mounting volumes in the container
* Bundling your application inside the container
* Creating reproducible builds using containers
* Kubernetes basics
* Orchestrating your containers using Kubernetes
* Kubernetes resiliance

The lab is composed of four exercises. Each exercise builds on the work done in the previous exercises, so we recommend completing them in order.
