== Exercise 2 - Java EE Development with Docker containers

NOTE: This is a beginner exercise.

=== What you will learn
Particpants will learn how to combine Java EE Development with maven and nexus together with Docker containers. Participants will also learn how to use Arquillian for testing in running containers.

=== Prerequisites

* Participants should successfully have executed exercise 1
* Participants should have cleaned up any running containers

TIP: To clean up all the running container run the following command `docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)`.

=== Compiling and deploying the project

Step 1 - Clone the project from the instructor git::
The instructor has a GIT repository running on classroom.example.com.
+
[source,numbered]
----
$ cd $HOME
$ git clone http://classroom.example.com:5002/ticket-monster.git
$ cd ticket-monster
----

Step 2 - Build the application::
+
[source,numbered]
----
$ mkdir -p ~/.m2
$ cp settings.xml ~/.m2
$ mvn clean package
----
+
If everything built correctly, you should see something like:
+
----
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time: 2:49.143s
[INFO] Finished at: Thu Jun 04 14:11:57 EDT 2015
[INFO] Final Memory: 27M/117M
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

Step 3 - Start the customized JBoss EAP container::
This step requires that the custom JBoss EAP container was built as part of exercise 1. It also requires that you copy jboss-dev.env that you created in exercise1 or download one that we provide via the `curl` command below.
+
[source]
----
$ curl -L http://classroom.example.com:5002/docker-jboss-eap/lab/jboss-dev.env > jboss-dev.env
$ docker run -it -p 9080:8080 -p 9990:9990 -p 9999:9999 --env-file=jboss-dev.env <your-alias>/jboss-eap:1.0
----

Step 4 - Verify access to the admin console::
Open a browser and go to http://localhost:9990 and login with username: `admin` and password: `admin-123`.
+

+
Check that no applications are deployed by clicking on the `Deployments` tab
+

Step 5 - Deploy an application from command line::
+
[source,bash]
----
$ mvn clean package jboss-as:deploy
----
+
NOTE: You will be promoted for a username and password. Use the same credential as in step 4.
+
Check the administration console again (might need to reload the page)
+

+
Verify that the application is deployed and working by opening a browser to <http://localhost:9080/ticket-monster>.
+

As we have just seen running a containerized application is very similar to running the application directly on the host!

=== Testing applications in container with Arquillian

No matter the development method your team prescribes, and no matter how rigidly you adhere to its principles, eventually you’re going to need to assert that your code works. Of course you could handle this manually by deploying the application and letting a human user follow a scripted test plan, but wherever possible it’s much more efficient and fail-proof to automate the test execution. So you’re going to need to write some tests.

Arquillian is an innovative and highly extensible testing platform for the JVM that enables developers to easily create automated integration, functional, and acceptance tests for Java middleware. Arquillian picks up where unit tests leave off, it handles all the plumbing of container management, deployment, and framework initialization, so you can focus on the business of writing test logic.

Arquillian integrates seamlessly with familiar testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit 4, TestNG 5), allowing tests to be launched using existing IDE, Ant, and Maven test plug-ins — without any add-ons.

By combining Docker with Arquillian one can run the integration in a platform that is identical to the production platform.



Step 6 - Run the Arquillian tests in a container::
+
Arquillian integrates with JBoss EAP by deploying the application and the Arquillian test harness. When using a remote JBoss EAP one must provide ip address (default 127.0.0.1), administration port (default 9999), username and password. These values are all configured in  `src/test/resources/arquillian.xml`. After deploying the application Arquillian uses a `Servlet` to communicate with the server and order it to run the test and send the report back to the client. For this we also need to configure which ip adress (default 127.0.0.1) and web port (default 8080) is used. The container we started uses port `9080`.
+
Verify that `src/test/resources/arquillian.xml` is using port 9080 and has correct username and password configured.
+
Run the test by using a maven profile called `arq-jbossas-remote`, like this:
+
[source]
----
$ mvn clean package -Parq-jbossas-remote
----
+
The test report is written to the command line and should look like this:
+
[source]
----

Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 2.11 sec

Results :

Tests run: 15, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1
----
+
The `arq-jbossas-remote` profile enables Arquillian tests which are just like any old JUnit test; they run as part of the build process in maven. However these Arquillian tests are actually run inside JBoss EAP and can, for example, use CDI.


Step 7 - Add a failing test::
To see how it may look when we get a failed test we can add a failing test on purpose. In the test test logic that we are using the number of shows is `6`. For the failing test we will assume that the expected value is `10`.
+
Open `src/test/java/org/jboss/examples/ticketmonster/test/rest/ShowServiceTest.java` in a text editor and add the following test method to it:
+
[source,java]
----
    @Test
    public void failingTest() {
      List<Show> shows = showService.getAll(new MultivaluedHashMap<String,String>());
      assertNotNull(shows);
      assertEquals(10,shows.size());
    }
----
+
Run the test again, and this time it should **FAIL**.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ mvn clean package -Parq-jbossas-remote
----
+
Resulsts in :
+
[source,bash]
----
-------------------------------------------------------
 T E S T S
-------------------------------------------------------
Running org.jboss.examples.ticketmonster.test.rest.BookingServiceTest
Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1, Time elapsed: 5.254 sec
Running org.jboss.examples.ticketmonster.test.rest.EventServiceTest
Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.795 sec
Running org.jboss.examples.ticketmonster.test.rest.ShowServiceTest
Tests run: 6, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 2.569 sec <<< FAILURE!
failingTest(org.jboss.examples.ticketmonster.test.rest.ShowServiceTest)  Time elapsed: 0.044 sec  <<< FAILURE!
java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<10> but was:<6>
	at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:88)
	at org.junit.Assert.failNotEquals(Assert.java:743)
	at org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:118)
  ...
  ...
  ...
----
Step 8 - Correct the test::
+
Looking at the error message we can see that expected number of shows was 10, but actual result was 6. Normally this would tell us that we have have a bug in our code. But since we purposely used the wrong expected value we can safely change the expected result to 6 and run the tests again.
+
Open `src/test/java/org/jboss/examples/ticketmonster/test/rest/ShowServiceTest.java` and change expected result to 6, like this:
+
[source,java]
----
    @Test
    public void failingTest() {
      List<Show> shows = showService.getAll(new MultivaluedHashMap<String,String>());
      assertNotNull(shows);
      assertEquals(6,shows.size());
    }
----
+
Run the test again to verify
+
[source,bash]
----
$ mvn clean package -Parq-jbossas-remote
----
+
This time we should have a `BUILD SUCCESS` message.

=== Clean up and prepare for next exercise
Before we move on to the next exercise the participant should stop any running containers and remove any stopped containers. This can be done with two simple commands:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
----

=== Summary
After the second exercise the participant should start to feel comfortable with running and managing containers locally in a development environment. The most important benefit of running docker in a development environment like this is that the container can be (almost) identical to the target production environment. This lowers the complexity of a Continuous Delivery environment, and improves the quality.
