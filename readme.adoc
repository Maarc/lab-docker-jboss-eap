# Docker and Kubernetes for JBoss EAP Developers

This is a self-paced lab, aimed at developers using, or wanting to use, Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Middleware.

It is a "lab-in-box"; we hope that the lab can be reused by others who want to teach Docker and Kubernetes to others.

If you want to *try out* the lab, take a look at link:lab.adoc[].

If you want to *run* the lab, take a look at link:instructor/README.adoc[].
